# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, {a, b, c}, for which, a**2 + b**2 = c**2 and such that, a < b < c
# Sides a and b - are the side points of a right triangle.
# Side c - is the hypotenuse of a right triangle.
# For example, 3**2 + 4**2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5**2.

# This program checks whether given three sides of a triangle forms a valid triangle or not.
# In mathematics, the triangle inequality states that for any triangle to be valid, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side.
# If a, b and c are three sides of triangle then following conditions must be satisfied for a valid triangle.

# sys.argv is a list in Python, which contains the command-line arguments passed to the script.

# Example
# To show how this works.

#    import sys
#    print(f"This is the name of the script: {sys.argv[0]}")
#    print(f"Number of arguments: {len(sys.argv)}")
#    print(f"The arguments are: {str(sys.argv)}")
# (Remember that sys.argv[0] is the name of the script.

# How run?
# $ python3 file.py arg1 arg2 arg3 arg4
