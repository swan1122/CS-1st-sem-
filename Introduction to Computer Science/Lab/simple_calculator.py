# An assertion is a sanity-check that you can turn on or turn off when you are done with your testing of the program.
# The easiest way to think of an assertion is to liken it to a raise-if statement (or to be more accurate, a raise-if-not statement). 
# An expression is tested, and if the result comes up false, an exception is raised.
